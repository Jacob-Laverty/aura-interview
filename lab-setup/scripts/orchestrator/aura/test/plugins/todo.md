# Custom Plugin

We need to write a custom plugin to compare the logs generated in `foo-transmit` with the logs generated by `foo-receive`. Specifically, we are concerned with writing the following comparison logic:

- Are the number of packets transmitted the same number as the packets that are received?

- Are the sizes of all packets transmitted equal to those received?

- What is the mean, median, and 99.9% latency between transmission and receipt?

Write a custom Ansible plugin to take as input the two log files, and generate the above statistics for integration with playbooks.
