# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file contains one possible part of the technical interview.
#
# The purpose of this test case is to launch the foo-receive and foo-transmit
# services on the appropriate nodes, wait for execution to complete, stop the
# services, gather results of the test, and finally, parse the results of the
# test to determine if the run was successful or not.
#
# Your goal in this portion of the technical interview is to utilize the
# provided ansible collection "aura.test" to add tasks to this playbook,
# accomplishing the goals outlined above. For the sake of this task, assume
# that all other dependent functions are available and work as expected
# (even if you were not asked to implement some of the other roles / plugs
# as a part of your interview).
